# API

Gateway: Think of it as a smart traffic controller that sits between the outside world (users, apps, or AI agents) and your internal systems (databases, files, or MCP tools). Instead of letting everyone talk directly to your sensitive servers, they talk to the Gateway first.

## Studio

The API Studio simplifies the deployment of your services to the Kong Gateway, transforming complex infrastructure tasks into a seamless "few-clicks" experience. Instead of writing declarative YAML or executing manual cURL commands against the Admin API, you can provision production-grade routing and security through an intuitive interface.
