# Integration

The API Development section is the core integration hub of the QuickIntegrate platform, providing a robust suite of tools to build and manage endpoints that connect with databases, file systems, and web services. Beyond standard REST architecture, the platform supports specialized execution models: `Schedulers for automated`, `time-based jobs`; `DBEvents to trigger logic based on real-time database changes (CDC)`; and `File Triggers to initiate workflows the moment a file is uploaded or modified`.

## Studio

Utilize the drag-and-drop functionality to incorporate Core Integration development Components that efficiently manage a wide range of integration scenarios. These components cover triggers, transformers, connectors, processors, data mappings and enabling flow invocation through REST, Events, Messages, Databases, Schedulers, Files, and Streams.

## Data API

The Data APIs represent the CRUD operations for existing database tables. Developers can seamlessly connect to the database, retrieve the tables, and generate CRUD APIs instantly with the click of a button within the integration flow interface

## Data Mapping

## Webhook

In the QuickIntegrate platform, the **Events** and **Subscriptions** pages allow you to manage how your system broadcasts real-time updates to external consumers. This section is essential for creating "event-driven" architectures where other apps react instantly to what happens in your system.
