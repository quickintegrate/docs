# Agentic

In the QuickIntegrate ecosystem, an Agent is a specialized AI configuration designed to achieve a high-level goal. Unlike a standard chatbot, an Agent:

- **Has Agency:** It chooses its own path to a solution.
- **Uses Tools:** It can call your MCP tools or APIs autonomously.
- **Maintains Memory:** It remembers previous steps in a "Service Flow" to inform the next action.
- **Executes Logic:** It follows "System Instructions" to maintain a specific persona and set of guardrails.

## Studio

Agentic Studio is where you design the Brain.

This is a low-code/no-code environment where you orchestrate multiple agents, define their reasoning loops, and connect them to the tools you've already built. It uses a Drag-and-Drop Canvas to visualize how data flows and how agents collaborate to solve complex, multi-step goals.
