# Global Error

The **Global Error** component serves to capture and manage errors across the API, ensuring a unified approach to error handling throughout the application.

Utilizing **Global Error** Handling promotes the reusability of error-handling code within the application, offering a standardized approach to managing errors at an application-wide level.

This method triggers whenever an error occurs within the application, receiving the error as a parameter for further processing. In our context, it prompts a dialog to display the error message and logs the error to the browser console.

To implement **Global Error**, simply drag and drop the **Global Error** component from the component list. Utilize other components to set your error message as needed.
