# SFTP Connector 

**SFTP** Connector provides access to files and folders on an **SFTP** server. **SFTP** Connector operations manage file transfers over the **SFTP** (Secure File Transfer Protocol) protocol. The Connectorâ€™s main features include

The ability to read files or list directory contents on demand

Support for common **SFTP** operations such as creating directories, copying, moving, renaming, and deleting files

Support for locking files

File matching functionality

A design that is consistent with that of File Connector and FTP Connector

The same set of operations is available on these Connectors, and they behave similarly.
