# MQ Connector

Java Message Service (**JMS Connector**) enables sending and receiving messages to queues and topics for any message service that implements the JMS specification. JMS is a widely used API for message-oriented middleware. It enables the communication between different components of a distributed application to be loosely coupled, reliable, and asynchronous. The main features of **JMS Connector** include:

Publish and subscribe pattern support on any given destination

Listen and reply pattern support on any given destination

Publish and consume pattern support on any given destination, with a fixed or temporary reply queue
