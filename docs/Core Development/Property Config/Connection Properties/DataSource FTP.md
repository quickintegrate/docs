# DataSource FTP

The FTP DataSource facilitates access to files and directories hosted on an FTP server. It efficiently handles file transfers through the File Transfer Protocol (FTP), offering the following main features:

1) Reading files or generating full directory listings upon request.
   
2) Supporting typical FTP operations like directory creation, file copying, moving, renaming, and deletion.
   
3) Enabling file locking.
   
4) Providing file matching functionality.
   
5) Sharing a design consistent with the File and FTP DataSources.
   
`These two DataSources offer a parallel set of operations, operating in similar manners.`
