# Build

Application Programming Interfaces, or APIs, are the interfaces that help us integrate third-party features, connect enterprise systems, and exchange data between apps.
Understanding the process of Building a API within the Quickintegration platform

#### Step 1: 

Save the application once you implement your API

<img src={useBaseUrl('/img/hello/4save.png')} />;

#### Step 2:

Go to **EXECUTE** >> **BUILD** 

<img src={useBaseUrl('/img/Core Development/Execute API/Build.png')} />;

#### Step 3:
To **Build** the application.
Click on the **Build Application** 

<img src={useBaseUrl('/img/Core Development/Execute API/Build application.png')} />;

#### Step 4:
Please access the dropdown menu and choose the appropriate project.

<img src={useBaseUrl('/img/Core Development/Execute API/drop down build.png')} />;


#### Step 5:

Within the properties section, you'll find the version and comment columns. Next, proceed by clicking the "Build Application" button to generate your API.

#### Step 6:

Once the application building process is finished, a popup will confirm the successful creation of your API.

<img src={useBaseUrl('/img/Core Development/Execute API/succesfully build.png')} />;
