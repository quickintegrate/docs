# Build
Understanding the process of Building an API within the Quickintegration platform holds significant importance.

Go to **Execute** >> **Build** API

<img src={useBaseUrl('/img/Build&Deploy/Execute-Build.png')} />;


When you navigate to the page,you'll encounter the successfully constructed Application. Click **Build Application** to begin the application-building process.

<img src={useBaseUrl('/img/Core Development/Execute API/Build application.png')} />;

Please access the dropdown menu and choose the appropriate project.

<img src={useBaseUrl('/img/Core Development/Execute API/drop down build.png')} />;


Within the properties section, you'll find the version and comment columns. Next, proceed by clicking the "Build Application" button to generate your API.


Once the application building process is finished, a popup will confirm the successful creation of your API.
